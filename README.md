## This is a collection of my Talks, Slides and Workshops.
I've given quite some talks and workshops in the last couple of years. Mostly regarding E-Commerce and Web-Performance. These topics are kind of my thing because i work with [SysEleven](http://www.syseleven.de/) - a High-End Hosting Provider specialized in Scalability and Performance. If you plan on doing TV-Commercials you should **seriously consider SysEleven**.

For all those years i've really been annoyed by this Powerpoint an Keynote crap. This has all come to an end because from now on i'm using **reveal.js** for my presentations. It's a beautiful yet nerdy framework for creating presentations which simply run in a browser. Reveal.js supports HTML and Markdown. Check out a [live Demo](https://thomaslohner.github.io/slides/#tools) in the Tools-Section. In fact it's so cool, i'm gonna redo all my presentations with reveal.js and post them here.

## This is a Github Pages Repository
I've created the website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the theme [SinglePaged theme](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged) and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). This is the Source-Repository for building the site:
