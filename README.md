## This is a collection of my Talks, Slides and Workshops.
I'm using reveal.js for my presentations, it's a beautiful yet nerdy framework for creating presentations which simply run in a browser. Reveal.js supports HTML and Markdown. Check out a live Demo in the [Tools-Section](https://thomaslohner.github.io/slides/#tools) of the Collection.

## This is a Github Pages Repository
I've created the website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the theme [SinglePaged theme](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged) and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). This is the Source-Repository for building the site:
