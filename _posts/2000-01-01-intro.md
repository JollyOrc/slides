## This is a collection of my Talks, Slides and Workshops.
I've given quite some talks and workshops in the last couple of years. Mostly regarding E-Commerce and Web-Performance. These topics are kind of my thing because i work with [SysEleven](http://www.syseleven.de/) - a High-End Hosting Provider specialized in Scalability and Performance. If you plan on doing TV-Commercials you should **seriously consider SysEleven**.

For all those years i've really been annoyed by this Powerpoint an Keynote crap. This has all come to an end because from now on i'm using **reveal.js** for my presentations. It's a beautiful yet nerdy framework for creating presentations which simply run in a browser. Reveal.js supports HTML and Markdown. Check out a [live Demo](#tools) in the Tools-Section. In fact it's so cool, i'm gonna redo all my presentations with reveal.js and post them here.

The Slides are mostly in German or English, depending on the audience and location where i give the talk. Don't hesitate to check out how to [Contribute](#contribute) if you want to translate any of this into another language.
